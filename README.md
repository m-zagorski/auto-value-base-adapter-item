AutoValue: BaseAdapterItem Extension
========

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) that supports BaseAdapterItem
interface from [RxJavaExtensions](https://github.com/jacek-marchwicki/rx-java-extensions)

To make the best out of `BaseAdapterItem` you have to implement `equals` `hashCode` and
additionally `same` `matches` and `adapterId` coming from the interface itself.
First two are granted by base `AutoValue`, rest are generated by this plugin.

## Usage

Simply include this extension in your peoject and you can use `@AutoValue` together with classes
implementing `BaseAdapterItem` 

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class Item implements BaseAdapterItem {
	
	public abstract String field();

}
```

## AdapterId

Out of the box this extension is generating base implementation of `matches` ie.
checking only `instanceof` also `adapterId` returns `NO_ID`, if you have multiple items
with the same type and your `matches` has to be more specific, you can annotate field 
with `@AdapterId` annotation. Only one field can be marked as `@AdapterId` and that field
has to be of `String` type.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class IdItem implements BaseAdapterItem {

	@AdapterId
	public abstract String id();

}
```

This will generate us corresponding matches method:


```java
@Override
public boolean matches(BaseAdapterItem var1) {
return var1 instanceof IdItem
	&& Objects.equal(id(), ((IdItem) var1).id());
}
```

also `adapterId` will return `id().hashCode()`

If by any reason you would like to have different `adapterId` you can just override
this method in your class.

## BaseAnimatedAdapterItem - not yet released in rx-java-extensions

This extension also supports `BaseAnimatedAdapterItem` but since it is not yet
released in rx-java-extensions details will be provided later.

## Sample
Sample just includes one model class which you can launch using `gradle` from command line
as there is an issue with android studio and the plugin.

```groovy
./gradlew build -x lint
``` 

Will generate `AutoValue_BaseItem`

## Download 

Add as a Gradle dependency

```groovy
compile 'com.appunite:auto-value-base-adapter-item:0.0.1'
```

You also need maven repo

```groovy
maven { url  "http://dl.bintray.com/mateusz/maven" }
```
